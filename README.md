# ML_CFD
This is a project of machine learning and computational fluid dynamics in the development

# Things to do
- Try cropping the images without losing too much information;
- Improve the case simulation and its mesh;
- Generating more simulations and using more time steps to improve loss;
- Understand TimeDistributed layers from TensorFlow;
- Conv3D, U-Net, TF-Net, FNO-2D, FNO-3D implementation.
